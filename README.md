GLucose

Processing Engine Library for Sugar Cubes. If you just want to work on art for the cubes, you should not need to touch this! Don't even check it out.

To open and work on this, you will need Eclipse.

1. Install Eclipse
2. Create a folder called "workspace" somewhere
3. git clone this project into that folder, so you have workspace/GLucose
4. Open Eclipse with that workspace
5. File | Import
6. General > Existing Projects Into Workspace > Next >
7. Select Root Directory | Browse | GLucose

Drag resources/build.xml into the Ant window on the right to build.
